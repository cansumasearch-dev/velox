# Changelog

All notable changes to Velox. This file is the single source of truth — it shows
up both on the GitHub release and in the WordPress "View details" → Changelog tab.
Add a new section at the top for each release.

## 1.7.2
- Added plugin icon and banner artwork to the "View details" popup and the update notice.

## 1.7.1
- Richer "View details" popup: full description, installation steps, FAQ and a properly formatted changelog.
- Changelog now reads from this `CHANGELOG.md` so it stays in sync everywhere.

## 1.7.0
- **Auto-learn used-CSS engine** — zero setup. Learns the real classes from your visitors' browsers (so it sees JS-added classes) and trims the rest. Can only ever keep more CSS, never break a layout.
- Used-CSS engine selector: Auto-learn (default) · Cloudflare Browser Run · Local.
- Live status and "Reset auto-learn" control in the CSS tab.

## 1.6.0
- **Cloudflare Browser Run engine** for accurate, JS-aware unused-CSS removal with no software to install — renders each page via Cloudflare's API and trims against the real DOM.
- Scan & build workflow with per-page caching.

## 1.5.0
- **Strong CSS optimizations** (Risky mode): non-render-blocking CSS delivery, inline critical CSS, and a conservative local Remove-Unused-CSS that fails open.

## 1.4.0
- **Local Google Fonts optimizer** — one-click download + self-hosting of Google Fonts.
- Settings import / export.

## 1.3.0
- **Image pipeline:** preserve-EXIF toggle, max-width downscaling, and live before→after file-size estimates on every image.

## 1.2.0
- **Performance overhaul:** Risky-mode toggle, in-tab Clear Cache panel, fetchpriority on the LCP image, YouTube facade, lazy-render, configurable delay-JS timeout, and exposed defer/delay exclusion lists.

## 1.1.2
- UI/UX overhaul: wider layouts, consistent cards, fully styled Media Editor, clearer navigation.

## 1.1.1
- Fixed settings persistence (saves now stick) and a one-time heal for previously corrupted settings.
- Admin-bar cache menu gated to the Performance module. Simplified the Updates panel.

## 1.0.0
- Initial release: WebP conversion, media editor, performance tweaks, database cleanup, and the GitHub self-updater.
